# QRWizard: QR Code Scanner App

QR Wizard, is a simple application that allows users to scan QR codes using their device's camera. The app utilizes the [ZXing Barcode Scanner](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded) library to enable QR code scanning and interpretation. When a QR code is scanned, the app can perform one of two actions depending on the content of the QR code:

1. If the scanned QR code contains a URL (starts with "http://" or "https://"), the app will open the URL in the device's default web browser.

2. If the scanned QR code does not contain a URL, the app will display a toast message with the scanned data.
